# 🛠️🦀 Setting Up Your Rust Environment

Rust ships as a coordinated toolchain: the compiler (`rustc`), package manager
and build tool (`cargo`), formatter (`rustfmt`), linter (`clippy`), documentation
tool (`rustdoc`), and standard library.

## 🦀 1. Install Rust with rustup

Follow the official instructions at <https://rustup.rs/>. On Linux and macOS the
installer command is:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

On Windows, download and run `rustup-init.exe`. Install the MSVC build tools
recommended by rustup. On Linux, install the distribution's C compiler/build
tools; on macOS, install the Xcode command-line tools. A linker is needed for
ordinary Rust binaries, and this repository's full workspace additionally
compiles bundled SQLite from C source.

Restart the terminal, then verify the installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup show active-toolchain
```

This course requires Rust 1.85 or newer because it uses edition 2024. Every
workspace package inherits `rust-version = "1.85"`, and CI checks the entire
locked dependency graph with Rust 1.85 as well as current stable Rust.

## 📥 2. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbrndiar/learning-rust.git
cd learning-rust
```

## 🧰 3. Install required components

The default installation profile usually includes the formatter and linter.
Installing them explicitly is safe:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt clippy
```

Use stable Rust unless a lesson explicitly discusses another channel:

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup update stable
```

`rust-toolchain.toml` files can pin a project-specific channel. This repository
instead declares its minimum compiler in `Cargo.toml` and lets stable advance.

## 🧑‍💻 4. Choose an editor

Any editor works. A common setup is:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
  [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
  extension; or
- [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) from JetBrains.

rust-analyzer uses the same Cargo metadata as the terminal. If editor diagnostics
disagree with Cargo, first confirm that both use the same workspace and toolchain.

## 🚀 5. Build and run the first lesson

```bash
cargo run --example lesson-01-hello-world
```

The first build downloads dependencies and compiles them. Later builds reuse
artifacts from `target/`.

## 🗂️ 6. Understand Cargo files

- `Cargo.toml` declares packages, workspace members, direct dependencies,
  targets, and configuration.
- `Cargo.lock` records exact dependency versions selected for this application
  workspace and is committed.
- `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `examples/`, `tests/`, and `benches/` are Cargo's
  conventional target locations. This course explicitly lists teaching examples
  because they are grouped into module directories.
- `target/` contains generated artifacts and should not be committed.

The root manifest is both the `learning-rust-course` package and a workspace
containing the Task applied project plus starter/solution packages for both
capstones.
`cargo run --example NAME` selects a teaching target, `cargo test -p NAME`
selects one package, and `--workspace` selects all eight packages.

Workspace dependency requirements are centralized in the root manifest:

| Requirement | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| exact Axum `0.8.9` and Actix Web `4.12.1` | Module 13 and Task server adapters |
| Clap `4.5` with `derive` | application command-line parsing |
| futures-util `0.3` | bounded Actix request-body streaming |
| exact Reqwest `0.13.4` with JSON and query only | Module 13 and Task loopback clients |
| Serde `1.0` and `serde_json` `1.0` | Module 13 and application JSON boundaries |
| openapiv3 `2.2` and serde_yaml_ng `0.10` | local Task OpenAPI validation |
| `thiserror` `2.0` | source-preserving typed errors |
| `tempfile` `3.20` | isolated persistence and filesystem tests |
| Tokio `1.46` | async and HTTP lessons and exercises |
| exact `rusqlite` `0.39.0` with `bundled` | Module 10, Task project, comparative capstone |

Manifest requirements describe allowed releases; `Cargo.lock` is the authority
for the exact versions currently tested. Repository gates use `--locked` so a
command fails instead of silently rewriting the lockfile. Omit `--locked` only
when intentionally adding or updating dependencies, then review the lockfile
diff and rerun the Rust 1.85 checks.

`rusqlite`'s `bundled` feature avoids a system SQLite library and headers by
building SQLite itself. That makes the database version reproducible but still
requires a working C compiler, linker, archiver, and platform SDK/build tools.

## 🏗️ 7. Create your own Cargo project

The course uses a workspace with explicitly named examples. Ordinary
applications start with a simpler generated package:

```bash
cargo new hello-rust
cd hello-rust
cargo run
```

Cargo creates:

```text
hello-rust/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

Edit `src/main.rs`; `fn main()` is the binary entry point. `cargo check`
type-checks quickly, while `cargo run` builds and executes the program.

When a project needs a third-party crate, prefer Cargo's dependency command:

```bash
cargo add serde --features derive
```

This updates `Cargo.toml`; the next Cargo command resolves the dependency and
updates `Cargo.lock`. Add a dependency only when the program uses it, and read
the crate's documentation for supported features and minimum Rust version.

The [`Beginner's Guide`](BEGINNER_GUIDE.md) explains how packages, crates,
targets, examples, and this workspace relate.

## 🔄 Daily development flow

Start narrow, then widen:

```bash
# Run the behavior you changed.
cargo test -p comparative-kv-solution milestone_1 --locked

# Apply canonical formatting.
cargo fmt --all

# Ask Clippy for static feedback and reject warnings.
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings

# Run application tests and documentation examples.
cargo test --workspace --lib --bins --locked
cargo test -p tasks-contracts --locked
cargo test -p tasks-starter --locked
cargo test -p tasks-solution --locked
cargo test -p comparative-kv-solution --locked
cargo test -p idiomatic-indexer-solution --locked
cargo test --doc --workspace --locked
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --locked

# Compile all teaching targets, including unfinished exercise starters.
cargo check --workspace --all-targets --locked

# Validate workspace membership and repository-local Markdown links.
cargo metadata --format-version 1 --locked --no-deps
python3 scripts/check-markdown-links.py
cargo audit
```

`cargo fmt` changes files. CI uses `cargo fmt --all --check` to verify that the
committed result is already formatted. Clippy suggestions are context-sensitive:
understand ownership and behavior before accepting an automated rewrite.

## 📊 Optional coverage tool

The CI workflow checks complete-application test coverage with
[`cargo-llvm-cov`](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov). To run the same
summaries locally:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --locked
cargo llvm-cov -p tasks-solution --all-targets --summary-only --fail-under-lines 85 --locked
cargo llvm-cov -p comparative-kv-solution --all-targets --summary-only --locked
cargo llvm-cov -p idiomatic-indexer-solution --all-targets --summary-only --locked
```

The starter packages are intentionally excluded because their milestone tests
are ignored until implemented. CI enforces 85% line coverage for the completed
Task solution and reports the capstone summaries without numeric thresholds.
Coverage remains a diagnostic signal, not a correctness score.

## 🔒 Optional dependency audit

Install and run RustSec's lockfile auditor with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-audit --locked
cargo audit
```

The repository-local `.cargo/audit.toml` documents one feature-scoped exception:
Actix Web compiles `time` formatting but not the parsing APIs affected by
`RUSTSEC-2026-0009`. Its fixed release requires Rust 1.88, so the exception
remains only while this course preserves Rust 1.85 compatibility.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### 🚫 `cargo` is not found

Restart the shell after installing rustup. On Unix-like systems, confirm that
`$HOME/.cargo/bin` is on `PATH`. The installer normally adds it to your shell
profile.

### ⏳ The compiler is too old

```bash
rustup update stable
rustup default stable
```

Then check `rustc --version`. If a directory has a pinned override, inspect it
with `rustup show` and remove it only when you understand why it exists.

### 🔗 A native dependency fails to link

Read the first linker error and install the platform build tools it names. On
Linux this commonly means a C compiler and development headers; on Windows it
often means Visual Studio Build Tools.

For errors mentioning `libsqlite3-sys`, `cc`, or SQLite while building the
comparative capstone, verify the C compiler and linker first. The `bundled`
feature means installing a system SQLite development package should not be
necessary.

### 🧹 The build cache is stale or very large

`cargo clean` deletes generated artifacts for the current workspace. It is safe
but usually unnecessary and makes the next build slower.

### 🌐 A dependency download fails

Retry after checking network and proxy configuration. Cargo's registry and Git
settings live under `$CARGO_HOME` (normally `~/.cargo`); do not commit personal
credentials or machine-specific configuration.
